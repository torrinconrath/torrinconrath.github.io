      <h3>How to Play?</h3>
      <p>Throughout this game, you will need to dodge and shoot the incoming ghosts. You move around with WASD and shoot with the arrow keys. 
        You have three hearts meaning you can get hit three times before the game is over.
        As time goes on, the ghosts will spawn faster and faster until it is impossible to continue.
      </p>
      <h3>Powerups</h3>
      <p>There will be five different powerups that can spawn throughout the game which can be used to your advantage.
        One of these will spawn every ten seconds, randomly on the map. They need to be collected in order to use them.
      </p>

        <li><img src="game_images/cannon.png" alt="Cannon Icon" class="list-icon">Cannon: No matter which arrow key the player clicks, 
          it will shoot bullets in all four directions.</li>
        <li><img src="game_images/bomb.png" alt="Bomb Icon" class="list-icon">Bomb: A bomb will start counting down and after five 
          seconds will wipe all the ghosts on the map.</li>
        <li><img src="game_images/poison.png" alt="Poison Icon" class="list-icon">Infection: When the player shoots the enemy, it will 
          spawn a zombie at the previously killed enemy's place. It will act as a dummy drawing some of the ghosts' attention to it.</li>
        <li><img src="game_images/barrier.png" alt="Barrier Icon" class="list-icon">Shield: The player will gain a shield which can
